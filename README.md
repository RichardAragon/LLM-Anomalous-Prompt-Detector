# LLM-Anomalous-Prompt-Detector
**# Outlier Detection App for Adversarial Text Anomaly Detection**

**## Overview**

This app is specifically designed to detect anomalous text patterns within prompts that could potentially indicate adversarial attacks. It employs various outlier detection techniques, tailored for identifying text anomalies that might pose security risks.

**## Purpose**

- Protect systems against adversarial attacks that attempt to manipulate or exploit natural language processing models through malicious text inputs.
- Safeguard against text-based attacks that aim to disrupt model performance, extract sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access.

**## Key Features**

- **Dynamic thresholds:** Adapts outlier detection criteria based on the characteristics of the input data, ensuring adaptability to diverse attack patterns.
- **Multiple outlier detection techniques:** Employs various methods to uncover different types of textual anomalies, offering a comprehensive defense against potential attacks.
- **Focus on adversarial text patterns:** Prioritizes detection of text anomalies that are commonly associated with adversarial attacks, ensuring a targeted approach to security.

**## Specific Anomaly Detection Types**

- **Rules and roleplay instructions:** Detects prompts that contain both rules and roleplay elements, which can be used to confuse or manipulate model behavior.
- **Color-changing code:** Identifies attempts to change the color of text, which might be used for visual distractions or to conceal malicious content.

**## Integration and Usage**

- Integrate this app into your NLP systems to pre-process prompts for adversarial text anomaly detection.
- Use the detected anomalies to:
    - Flag potentially harmful prompts for further review.
    - Filter out suspicious inputs before model processing.
    - Trigger additional security measures.

**## Continuous Improvement**

- Regularly update keyword lists and regular expressions to stay abreast of evolving adversarial tactics.
- Explore advanced outlier detection techniques to enhance robustness against sophisticated attacks.
- Collaborate with security experts to refine anomaly detection criteria and adapt to emerging threats.
